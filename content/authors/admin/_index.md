## About Me

Hi, I‚Äôm Rachel Guo! I‚Äôm a data and business analyst with experience across tech, retail, and consumer products, recently graduated from my Master‚Äôs in Business Analytics at UC Davis after studying economics at Columbia. I enjoy making sense of messy problems and translating data into insights that drive strategy and improvement.

At Amazons, I analyzed 700K+ rows of data to uncover traffic patterns and guide new store launches. I also automated dashboards that cut manual reporting and led weekly performance deep dives to align retail, marketing, and merchandising teams.

At L‚ÄôOr√©al, I designed A/B tests and modeling across 10 countries to find the most profitable sampling strategy, which shaped the company‚Äôs 2023 global plan. I also built dashboards for 21 regional markets to track sales drivers more effectively.

At Est√©e Lauder, I applied NLP and XGBoost to thousands of Instagram posts, identifying engagement drivers that boosted social reach by 5%. I also supported global CRM and loyalty programs through Salesforce.

At TikTok Ads, I built self-service analytics tools with Excel VBA that reduced manual reporting by 33%. I also evaluated ad performance data for 200+ advertisers to generate insights on campaign engagement.

At The Best Notary, I rebuilt legacy Excel reports into Looker dashboards and built SQL/Python pipelines to improve match accuracy by 17%. These tools gave product and ops teams clearer KPIs for decision-making.

Outside of work, I co-created PitchSense, an AI fundraising tool that won ‚ÄúMost Impactful Award‚Äù at AgentHack 2025, and NeuroPolis, a disaster prediction platform recognized as a Top 3 finalist at UC Davis AggieHacks.

üëâ Currently exploring my next opportunity in data-driven strategy, growth, and continuous improvement. Let‚Äôs connect!
