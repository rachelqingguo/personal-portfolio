Hi, I'm Rachel!  
I specialize in blending business strategy with data science to drive actionable insights.  
With professional experiences at L'Oréal, Estée Lauder, and TikTok, I focus on pricing strategy, market analytics, and predictive modeling.  
Currently, I'm pursuing my M.S. in Business Analytics at UC Davis and actively applying machine learning techniques in real-world business challenges.
