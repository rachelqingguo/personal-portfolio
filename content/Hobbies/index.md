## ðŸ§­ Off the Clock

Outside of work, I recharge by exploring new places â€” Iâ€™ve traveled to 25+ countries, enjoy hiking, and love scuba diving. These moments on the move often inspire the way I approach my work and the kinds of projects I pursue.  
ðŸ“¸ Photos coming soon.

### ðŸŒ± Projects That Left a Mark

Across four continents and five countries, Iâ€™ve applied analytics and business thinking to help solve real problems in real communities:

- ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ **China** â€“ Led survey and outreach efforts for Stanfordâ€™s Hepatitis B campaign, helping shift public perception and raise $9,000+ in support from WHO and Apple.  
- ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¿ **Tanzania** â€“ Created a business and funding strategy for a bottle recycling startup, connecting it with local banks and tour operators to boost visibility and growth.  
- ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ **Czech Republic** â€“ Co-led cultural workshops with volunteers from seven countries, using live feedback to improve content delivery.  
- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· **France** â€“ Supported refugee nonprofits with English and job readiness training, adjusting each week to better meet learnersâ€™ needs.  
- ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· **Brazil** â€“ Collaborated with Rioâ€™s City Hall on G20 policy recommendations, analyzing stakeholder interviews and global climate finance strategies to help shape the cityâ€™s climate tech investment agenda.

These experiences deepened my belief that business, when done right, can be a powerful tool for social change. Itâ€™s this perspective I hope to bring to future work at Anderson and to every team Iâ€™m part of going forward.
