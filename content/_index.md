      subtitle: ''

        Across four continents, I‚Äôve worked on mission-driven projects where analytics and business strategy met real-world challenges.

        In China, I led survey analysis and audience segmentation for Stanford‚Äôs Asian Liver Center to address Hepatitis B stigma, reaching 100+ villagers and securing $9,000+ in support from organizations like WHO and Apple. In Tanzania, I developed growth and funding strategies for a local recycling startup, helping secure bank partnerships and increasing exposure through the tourism sector.

        In the Czech Republic, I co-designed cultural learning workshops with a team of volunteers from seven countries, using participant feedback to refine programs. In France, I supported refugee nonprofits through English and vocational training ‚Äî adjusting workshops based on learner response and retention.

        These experiences shaped my approach to impact: grounded in community needs, driven by data, and executed through adaptable, scalable action.
